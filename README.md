### Road map:

<ul>
<li>I have created JSON data(stored in 'Public' ) as of myself for this project. On the go through of my journey, I used plain CSS as well as Bootstrap & React Bootstrap. I also extended my dependencies for the smooth go of this project.</li>
<li> I used many components(About,Contact,Footer,Header,Home,NotFound,Review,Reviews) with npm installation.</li>
<li>I had to go for React Router Dom for making Routes on the go of this project.</li>
<li>I used custom hook for data fetching.</li>
<li>I used firebase authentication here.</li>
</ul>
